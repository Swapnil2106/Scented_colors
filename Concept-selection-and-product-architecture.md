**The best concept selected is Design 3**

|Design Table|Objective|Score given|Justification|
|-|-|-|-|
|1|Automatic|0|On proper working of both the designs(w.r.t Datum), it can be noted that automaticity are of equal magnitudes, things to be done by the user are turning the device on/off, and place the object|
||Accurate|8|There are chances for proper sensing , yet faulty sorting in design 4, compared to design 1|
||Safety|7|A throw action is observed in design 4, which is a black spot with safety aspect. Design 1 is safer|
||Compact|6|Installing vacuum mechanism consumes more space, than the conveyor mechanism. Thus design 1 is more compact|
||Speed|5|Vacuum suction is a slower process, than the grounded movement of the objects on conveyor and arm|
||Portable|6|Since design 1 is more compact, its portability is higher than that of design 4|
||Rugged|2|Vacuum mechanisms involved devices must be handled with higher care. with this, design 1 is more rugged|
|2|Automatic|0|On proper working of both the designs(w.r.t Datum), it can be noted that automaticity are of equal magnitudes, things to be done by the user are turning the device on/off, and place the object|
||Accurate|8|There are chances for proper sensing , yet faulty sorting in design 4, compared to design 2|
||Safety|7|A throw action is observed in design 4, which is a black spot with safety aspect. Design 2 is safer|
||Compact|12|Device in Design 2 is very small compared to that in design 4|
||Speed|5|Vacuum suction is a slower process, than the movement of the objects on a slider|
||Portable|3|Since design 2 is more compact, its portability is higher than that of design 4|
||Rugged|0|The risk factor of both the machines are considered to be the same|
|3|Automatic|0|On proper working of both the designs(w.r.t Datum), it can be noted that automaticity are of equal magnitudes, things to be done by the user are turning the device on/off, and place the object|
||Accurate|16|There are chances for proper sensing , yet faulty sorting in design 4, compared to design 3. The sorting mechanism is more efficient in terms of movement in design 3|
||Safety|7|A throw action is observed in design 4, which is a black spot with safety aspect. Design 3 is safer|
||Compact|6|Device in Design 3 is very small compared to that in design 4|
||Speed|10|Vacuum suction is a slower process, where as, there is a quick movement of motors in multi directional conveyor|
||Portable|3|Since design 3 is more compact, its portability is higher than that of design 4|
||Rugged|4|Vacuum mechanisms involved devices must be handled with higher care. with this, design 3 is more rugged|

|5|Automatic|0|On proper working of both the designs(w.r.t Datum), it can be noted that automaticity are of equal magnitudes, things to be done by the user are turning the device on/off, and place the object|
||Accurate|0|Both design 4 and 5 have the same mechanism pick and place, only change is the grip it has on the object which doesn't bother the accuracy|
||Safety|-7|In Design 5, the arms drop the objects from a greater height, so, less safer than design 4|
||Compact|6|Design 5 occupies a smaller space for its functioning, than design 4|
||Speed|5|The time for vacuum suction is absent in design 5|
||Portable|6|Since design 5 is more compact,its portability is higher|
||Rugged|2|Design 4 is not adaptable everywhere, so its ruggedness is lesser than design 5|
|6|Automatic|0|On proper working of both the designs(w.r.t Datum), it can be noted that automaticity are of equal magnitudes, things to be done by the user are turning the device on/off, and place the object|
||Accurate|0|Vacuum suction and placing, and , hydraulic arms for pushing, have a similar accuracy|
||Safety|7|Since its a grounded movement of objects in design 6, the objects will be safer|
||Compact|0|Both designs are equally bulky|
||Speed|5|Pushing requires lesser time than picking and placing|
||Portable|0|Equally bulky designs have similar portability|
||Rugged|-2|Hydraulic arm mechanism is less prone to rough handling|

## Interaction details:
**Material interaction:** Solids,liquids, and gases that flow from one subsystem to the next.

**Energy interaction:** Energies that must be transmitted or shielded between sub systems.

**Data interaction:** Signals(tactile, acoustic, electrical, visual, etc.) that must be processed from one subsystem to the next.

**Spatial interaction:** Geometrical dimensions, degrees of freedom, tolerances and constraints that must be maintained between the subsystems.
