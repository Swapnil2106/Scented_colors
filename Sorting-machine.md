# Phase 1:Problem definition

|  Questions such as|   This question helps the designer to   |
|----|----|
|1.What should the machine be able to do?|
|2.What objects are to be sorted?|
|3.Based on which parameter the object be sorted?|Establish clients objective's|
|4.Which type of technique should be used to sort the objects?|
|5.|
|6.What are the possible shapes of the object?|Identify constraints|
|7.What are the dimensions of the object?|
|8.How much does the object weigh?|
|9.What are the dimension of the machine?|
|10.What can be cost of making the machine?|
|11.Should the objects be placed manually on the conveyor belt?|Establish functions|
|12.Should the object be only detected?|
|13.Should the object be sorted on the base of color?|
|14.Should the object be sorted on the base of its shape?|

Following was the information obtained through basic research and customer interaction

|Observation from lit survey |Requirements|
|----|-----|
|Based on dimensions|The machines should have reasonable size|
|Based on sorting|The machine should be able to detect different types of colors|
|Based on the objects|The machine should be able to move the object from one place to another place|
|Process of completion |The machine should be able to complete the task automatically without any human help|

## 1.1 Identify clients objective

|Sl.no|objectives|
|---|---|
|1.|Sorting machines for sorting incense stick box|
|2.|Considered sorting parameters for sorting:color and shape|
|3.|Automated process of sorting|
|4.|Size of machine should be small|
|5.|The machine should be user friendly|

## Prioritize the identified design objective

Prioritize among various objectives is set through a technique called Pair-wise Comparison Chart(PCC)
