## 2.2: List of main functions of a system

1.Input and storage.

2.Sensing.

3.Sorting.

4.Count and notifying.

## 2.3 user interaction-system behavior table

### 1. Input and storage 

|User interaction |System Behavior|
|-|-|
|1.Turn the machine on|* Machines turns on|
||* Check the availability of the object|
||* Lets the user know if the objects need to be placed|
|2.Places the object|* Accept the object|
||* moves the object|

### 2. Sensing 

|User interaction|System behavior|
|-|-|
|Enter the code for sensing process| Pass under the sensor |
||Extract the code written|
||Senses the object shape|
||Senses the color of object|

### 3. Sorting

|User Interference|System behavior|
|-|-|
|Enter the code for sorting process|Extracts the code|
||Controls the movement of objects|
||Sorts and places the objects in compartments based on its shape and color|

### 4. Counting and notifying 

|User interference |System behavior|
|-|-|
|1. Read the count |keep a count of the objects|
|2. Fetch the object|Display the count|

## 2.4: Functional tree


## 2.5: Write the glass box representation of the above system 


## 2.6: Complete the morphological chart by exploring the other alternative means of achieving the sub functions.

|Functions|Mean 1|Mean 2| Mean 3| Mean 4|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Machine operation|Switch|Mobile application|Remote controller|WiFi/Bluetooth|
|Movement|Conveyor belt|Multi-directional Conveyor|Vacuum suction |pick and placing|
|Sensing|IR sensor|Camera(vision sensor)|TCS230|
|Sorting|Pick and place|Multi-directional conveyor|slider|Vacuuum suction|
|Notification|Beep sound|LED light|Digital display|vibration|
|Placing of objects|Different boxes|Bowls|compartments in a shelf|

## Task 2.7:In the above table draw the selection path showing the concepts. Draw four conceptual models below.
