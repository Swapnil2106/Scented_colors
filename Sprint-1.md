# Multi Directional Conveyor

## Fabrication Plan
We use aluminium c channel for the frame. Aluminium c channels are fixed over the foam sheet wherein the ball bearings are fitted.Parallel shafts are interconnected with flat rubber bands. Acrylic sheet wheels are inserted into the shafts. And both the center shafts are connected to motor.

## Interaction Aspect

With Subsystem 1: Objects are placed on Multi Directional Conveyor using Subsystem objects are after sorting are placed in subsystem 3
