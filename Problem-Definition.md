# >Case Study<br>
1.    Designers: Jagadish M.B, M R Sai Rachan, Kiran Kori, Swapnil Kore
2.    Need Statement:"Sorting Machine"
3.    Clients:Cycle incense factory,Bangalore.
4.    Users:Factory workers.
<br>

|  Questions such as|   This question helps the designer to   |
|----|----|
|1.What should the machine be able to do?|
|2.What objects are to be sorted?|
|3.Based on which parameter the object be sorted?|Establish clients objective's|
|4.Which type of technique should be used to sort the objects?|
|5.What are the possible shapes of the object?|Identify constraints|
|6.What are the dimensions of the object?|
|7.How much does the object weigh?|
|8.What are the dimension of the machine?|
|9.What can be cost of making the machine?|
|10.Should the objects be placed manually on the conveyor belt?|Establish functions|
|11.Should the object be only detected?|
|12.Should the object be sorted on the base of color?|
|13.Should the object be sorted on the base of its shape?|

## >Obtain the information through basic survey and customer interaction and arrive at requirements

|Observation from lit survey |Requirements|
|----|-----|
|1.Based on dimensions|The machines should have reasonable size|
|2.Based on sorting|The machine should be able to detect different types of colors|
|3.Based on the objects|The machine should be able to move the object from one place to another place|
|4.Process of completion |The machine should be able to complete the task automatically without any human help|
|5.Based on the cost of completing the machine|cost of the machine should be up to Rs.4000|

## >1.1 Identify clients objective

|Sl.no|objectives|
|---|---|
|1.|Sorting machines for sorting incense stick box|
|2.|Considered sorting parameters for sorting:color and shape|
|3.|Automated process of sorting|
|4.|Size of machine should be small|
|5.|The machine should be user friendly|

## >1.2 Prioritize the identified design objective

Prioritize among various objectives is set through a technique called Pair-wise Comparison Chart(PCC)

|objectives|Sorting machines|Automated process|Small size|User friendly|Color and Shape|
|----|----|---|----|-----|----|
|Sorting machine|****|1|1|1|1|
|Automated process|0|***|1|1|1|
|Small size|0|0|***|0|1|
|User friendly|0|0|1|***|1|
|Color and Shape|0|0|0|0|***|

## >Problem definition version<sub>(1.1)</sub>

**"Design a small,user friendly and automatic sorting machine which can sort incense sticks boxes based on its color and shape".**
<br>

## >1.3 Identify constraints

1.Size of the machine.

2.Weight of the machine.

3.Shapes and colors of the incense stick boxes

## >Problem definition version(1.2)</sub>
**"Design a small,user friendly and automatic sorting machine which can sort incense sticks boxes based on its color and shape". The machines can weigh upto 3 kgs, with dimensions 1ft x 1ft x 1.5 ft. The boxes are of two shapes, cylindrical and cuboidal respectively with dimensions 5cm dia and 20cm height, and 5x1.5x20 in cms weighing 100gms. The boxes shall be in red or green colour".**

## >1.3 Identify functions

1.The boxes under the sorting process move on the conveyor belt.

2. The boxes shall be placed in their respective compartments after sorting.

3. The boxes having physical characteristics other than the mentioned constraints shall be treated faulty.
