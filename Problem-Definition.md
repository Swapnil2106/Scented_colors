## >Obtain the information through basic survey and customer interaction and arrive at requirements

|Observation from lit survey |Requirements|
|----|-----|
|1.Based on dimensions|The machines should have reasonable size|
|2.Based on sorting|The machine should be able to detect different types of colors|
|3.Based on the objects|The machine should be able to move the object from one place to another place|
|4.Process of completion |The machine should be able to complete the task automatically without any human help|
|5.Based on the cost of completing the machine|cost of the machine should be up to Rs.4000|

## >1.1 Identify clients objective

|Sl.no|objectives|
|---|---|
|1.|Portable accurate sorting machines for sorting incense stick box|
|2.|Considered sorting parameters for sorting:color and shape|
|3.|Automated process of sorting|
|4.|The machine should be compact|
|5.|The machine should be durable and time efficient|

## >1.2 Prioritize the identified design objective

Prioritize among various objectives is set through a technique called Pair-wise Comparison Chart(PCC)
